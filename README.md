# DemoMvcWithBlazor

Clone the repo, it should be ready to run. You *will* need to build the Blazor project first.

You can swap the Counter component for any other component in `Index.cshtml` by finding the line 

`<div id="app" component="BlazorApp.Pages.Counter">Loading...</div>`

And replacing the word Counter with any other compiled component.

This project is ASP.NET MVC running on .NET Framework 4.7.1 but the solution is tested as far down as .NET Framework 2.1
